###Collaborative Replication in Developmental Psychology

**Organizers:**
* Michael C. Frank, Stanford University, mcfrank@stanford.edu
* Rebecca A. Lundwall, Brigham Young University, rebecca_lundwall@byu.edu
* Elika Bergelson, Duke University, elika.bergelson@duke.edu

**Cost:** $5

**Workshop Goals:** 
The goals of the workshop are both to situate the ManyBabies project amongst other ongoing collaborative projects and to provide specific guidance (in the form of dos-and-donâ€™ts) for researchers from students to PIs who are interested in getting involved with large-scale collaborations. Attendees will leave with better understanding of several efforts currently underway for expanding collaboration and replicability efforts across areas of developmental science, and actionable steps for taking advantage of resources and knowledge often siloed in individual labs.
