- Identify spin-offs with letter? MB1L?
- Identify secondary analysis with SA? MB1SA
- Add "6" for at-home, even if they are methodological in nature... Otherwise we need another category... to complex
  - by doing that we keep the chronological classification as the main one.
- more stats on the last paragraph?

Obs.
- research questions in "notes.txt"

The broader goals of **ManyBabies** come together in a set of collaborative projects. Which can be of three types:

1. *Main project*: tests a question about infant development of key theoretical or methodological interest. They are numbered sequentially (e.g., MB1, MB2);

2. *Spin-off project*: builds on the methods or data from the main projects and are pre-registered before all the data necessary to the spin-off project has been collected. Some examples include extending the study to a different population of infants (e.g., bilinguals; additional geographically/culturally diverse samples), follow-up data collection (e.g., longitudinal correlation with CDIs; test-retest reliability), and additional analyses of the main dataset beyond the main project that were pre-registered prior to the complection data collection (e.g., methods moderators). Spin-off projects are identified with a letter in front of the main project abbreviation (e.g., MB1B, for bilinguals; MB1L, for longitudinal);

3. *Secondary analyis*: are conducted on publicly-available **MB** data, from the main project and/or spin-off projects. In some cases, these analysis may include additional data not collected as part of ManyBabies, for example if an individual lab investigates relationships between their labâ€™s ManyBabies data and other data collected by their lab. Secondary analysis are identified with the letters SA following the main project abbreviation (e.g., MB1SA).

Overall, **MB** currently counts 6 main projects, 5 spin-off projects, and 2 secondary analysis; listed below. Together, they account for 30+ research questions, hundreds of contributors, and thousands of infant participants.

## Get involved & New Projects

We encourage everyone who is interested in developmental research to get involved! Please note that access to infants/infant lab is **not** a prerequisite. There are several ways to [learn more and contribute]({{site.baseurl}}/get_involved/).

If you are interested in leading a new **ManyBabies** project (either a main project or a spin-off that would involve data collection across multiple labs), please [sign up]({{site.baseurl}}/sign_up_log_in/) and follow the instructions for proposing a new project. Alternatively, you can get in touch with the Governing Board by e-mailing manybabies-gb [at] mailman.stanford.edu.
