## Background

The first ManyPrimates project will investigate short-term memory across primates. As such, it is a continuation of our [pilot study](pilot.html "pilot study"). We hope to increase the number of species and individuals per species in order to make meaningful inferences about the evolution of short-term memory abilities in the primate lineage.

## Status

We are currently working on the preregistration for the second round of data collection. If you would like to be part of this process, please [get in touch](mailto:{{ site.email }}).
