# Comparison of the ManyBabies 1 results to meta-analytic data
<!-- Description (300-word?) intro + method + result -->

Meta-analyses are often considered to be the most reliable source of information when it comes to deciding whether a phenomenon is real, and how strong the effect is. However, large-scale collaborations, such as ManyBabies, often yield different results than published meta-analyses. To better understand how the two ways to collect and analyze large datasets are related (or not), we update the meta-analysis on infant-directed speech preference and subject it to a joint analysis.
