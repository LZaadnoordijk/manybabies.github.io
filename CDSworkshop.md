### Collaborative Replication in Developmental Psychology

**Organizers:**
* Michael C. Frank, Stanford University, mcfrank@stanford.edu
* Rebecca A. Lundwall, Brigham Young University, rebecca_lundwall@byu.edu
* Elika Bergelson, Duke University, elika.bergelson@duke.edu

**Cost:** $5

**Workshop Goals:** 
The goals of the workshop are both to situate the ManyBabies project amongst other ongoing collaborative projects and to provide specific guidance (in the form of dos-and-donâ€™ts) for researchers from students to PIs who are interested in getting involved with large-scale collaborations. Attendees will leave with better understanding of several efforts currently underway for expanding collaboration and replicability efforts across areas of developmental science, and actionable steps for taking advantage of resources and knowledge often siloed in individual labs.

**Schedule**

Time | Presenter | Topic
------------ | ------------- | -------------
1:00-1:05 | Lundwall | *Introduction and Goals of the Workshop*
1:05-1:25 | Ebersole | *Grownup ManyLabs: How it Works.* Ebersole is one of the coordinators and drivers of the ManyLabs collaborative replication projects in social/cognitive psychology. He will explain how these projects move forward, as well as describing some of the challenges of doing large-scale collaborative work.
1:25-1:40 | Hamlin | *Reproducibility and Replicability in Infancy Research.* Hamlin is a leading expert on moral development and infancy message (and organizer of a recent workshop on methodological challenges in developmental work). She will provide a broad theoretical overview of the workshop themes.
1:40-1:55 | Frank | *ManyBabies 1: Where We Are Now.* Frank is the coordinator of ManyBabies 1. He will present the study motivation, design, and its progress to date.
1:55-2:10 | Bergelson | *21st Century Collaborations: General Lessons from Cross-Lab Coordination.* Bergelson is involved in a variety of large-scale projects, including DARCLE/Homebank and ManyBabies, and will present some insights from these experiences that are relevant to other researchers trying to organize larger projects. She will specifically compare and contrast issues relevant to inter-operability and cross-fertilization across data-sets from naturalistic date collection (i.e. home recordings) and those that pertain to constrained and controlled in-lab data collection.
2:10-2:25 | Cusack | *Online Platforms for Developmental Research.* Cusack will discuss recently developed approaches to testing infants in studies over the internet, including habituation, and discrimination methods. In particular, he'll discuss the pros and cons of moving in-lab experiments onto the internet, and the concomitant aspects of sampling and data quality this shift allows.
2:25-2:40 | Wood | *Replication in the Comparative Setting.* Wood is a developmental and comparative psychologist and will present insights from the large scale replication projects he is carrying out to look at controlled rearing studies with chicks.
2:40-3:00 | N/A | Coffee break
3:00-4:00 | Guided Discussion | *What's Next for ManyBabies.* The final portion of the workshop will be devoted to discussion and planning of new ManyBabies studies and other large-scale collaborative projects. In preparation for this discussion, we will circulate a survey to confirmed workshop attendees asking for suggestions for projects that they would like to discuss. A pre-emptive survey has confirmed attendance and interest from over a dozen research labs. We will then compile ares of particular interest, and brea participants into groups to discuss these interests (e.g., a replication study of social cognition, or a new consortium study of word learning) and report back to the group. The goal would be for participants to come away with new connections for large scale collaborative projects (whether they are under the ManyBabies umbrella or otherwise).
